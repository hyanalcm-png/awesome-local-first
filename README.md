## 🤝 Contributing
Pull requests welcome!
Add tools, libraries, or case studies that advance **local-first**, **offline-first**, or **sync-centric** development.

Important I cant not add every possible package that related to local first in some way I want to only focus on projects that already have a bigger majority level and are also used by many people
